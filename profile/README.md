Welcome to the **Acronity** organization's `.github` repository! This is a special repository that provides default community health files, workflow templates, and organization-wide configurations for all repositories in the Acronity organization.

## 📋 About

This repository serves as the central location for:

- **Community Health Files**: Default issue templates, pull request templates, contributing guidelines, and code of conduct
- **Workflow Templates**: Reusable GitHub Actions workflow templates for CI/CD
- **Organization Profile**: The README displayed on the organization's profile page
- **Default Files**: License files, security policies, and support documentation

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```
.github/
├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/       # Default issue templates for all repositories
